# To-Do List App

This is a simple to-do list app built on React.js. Users can add new tasks to the list, edit or delete existing tasks, mark tasks as completed, and unmark them if desired. 

## Features

- Add tasks: Users can easily add a new task to their to-do list by simply typing it into the input field and clicking "Add".
- Edit tasks:  If a user wants to change the text of an existing task, they can simply click on the 'Edit' button, edit it and click anywhere to save the changes.
- Delete tasks: If a user no longer needs a particular task, they can click the "Delete" button next to the task to delete it from their list.
- Mark tasks as completed: If a user has completed a task, they can click on the checkbox next to the task to mark it as completed.
- Unmark completed tasks: If a user mistakenly marked a task as completed or decided to unmark it for any reason, they can simply click on the checkbox again to unmark it.
